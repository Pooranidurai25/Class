Summary of Day1 session:
========================

Why java?
WORA - PlatformInDependency
IDE - netBeans, eclipse, IJ
Craete project, Package, class
Shortcuts
keywords,datatypes,variables
naming covention standards
Conditional Statements - IF
Iterative/Looping statement - for, while, do while

Summary of July-11-2021
=======================
Conditional Statements
switch case 

jumping Statements - continue, break
                   - continue --> skip that condition alone 
                   - break    --> comes out of the loop totally

class
Object - Physical  entity

1. How it looks? / property/ State  -- variables
   -- colur
   -- isFurry

2. What is it going to do? action/Behaviour -- methods
   --bark
   -- canSmell
   --canJump

Class replicate the object/ Blueprint of the object

method:
========
  method signature:
    access specifier + returnType + methodName + arguments(if any)

  Access specifiers:
To set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors
Method level access specifiers:
-------------------------------
- public
- protected
- package ( default)
- private 

- Passing arguments - Value passed to the methods through arguments
- Returning values  - Values are used from the methods by using return statement


Access Specifier for class : public and package


Instance Variables and Instance Methods :
Accessed only thr objects
So, create an instance and call these components

ClassRoom:
==========
- Create package name as week1.day2
- Create a  new class as "Mobile" under week2.day1
- Create 2 public methods (makeCall() , sendMsg()) with simple print statement
- Create a private method payBills() with simple print statement
- Create main method

- Create object for Mobile class and call the methods using the object
- Execute the class and get the result in console


- Create a new class as MyKid in week2.day1 package
- Create an object for the previous class "Mobile"
- Try to access all the 3 methods of class "Mobile"

ARRAY:
-----
- An array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location-
- We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
- Array in Java is index-based

Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. 
            It doesn't grow its size at runtime.
            To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.
- length of an array

- Access through - for loop and for each

Printing an array in reverse order:
Sort the array
Print in reverse oeder using for loop

Class room:
==========
1. Create an character array 
2. Print the length of the array
3. Print all the elemnts of the array ( use for and for each loop)
4. Print all the elemnts of the array in reverse order ( use for and for each loop)

To print the last element of the array

Exception: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException


STRINGS:
=======

1. Length
2. charAt()
3. indexOf()
4. lastIndexOf()
5. toCharArray()
6. split()




7. replace
8. replace integers, non integers
str.replaceAll("[\\d]", ""); - non integers
str.replaceAll("[\\D]", ""); - integers
9. .equals
9. toLowerCase
10. toUpperCase
11. startsWith()
12. endsWith()
